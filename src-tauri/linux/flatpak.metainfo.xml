      <description>
        <p>Added</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job Group Management: Jobs are now automatically organized by remote name and profile name (e.g., all sync operations for "gdrive" with "default" profile are grouped together named "sync/Google Drive/default"). This makes it easier to view stats per remote and manage operations.</li>
          <li>rclone rc core/du added: When a remote is mounted, it shows disk usage inside the Mount Control accordion.</li>
          <li>New nautilus icons from Morewaita icon theme.</li>
          <li>Added more notifications for various app events.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>When memory optimization is enabled, the app only reopens from the tray icon.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rclone update writable path check: The app now checks if the preconfigured rclone path is writable. If not, it uses the default config path.</li>
          <li>Fixed containerized version for path handling.</li>
          <li>Other small fixes and improvements.</li>
        </ul>

    </release>
    <release version="0.2.0" date="2026-02-01">
      <description>
        <p>Added</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Settings Management Library (rcman): Extracted and refactored the internal settings management system into a standalone, reusable Rust library called rcman. This provides schema-based configuration, backup/restore, secret storage, and a derive macro for automatic schema generation. The app now uses rcman as an external dependency.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added dot and other text files preview support. Now you can preview the content of dot and other text files.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added markdown preview support. Now you can preview the content of markdown files.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added code highlight support. Now you can preview the content of code files with syntax highlighting.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added bulk hash calculation support. Now you can calculate the hash of multiple files inside a directory.</li>
          <li>Multiple backend support added. Now you can connect multiple and remote rclone instances via a single app. Remote config unlock supported (via rc config/unlock). Path change support added to (via rc config/setpath).</li>
          <li>Multiple profile support added for backends. Every backend has a own remote settings profile. Also supported the export and import.</li>
          <li>Multiple language support added. Now you can change the language of the app. Needs community help for translations.</li>
          <li>Log file support added (both app and rclone logs). You can manage the log settings from configuration modal (Log file location cannot be changed on rclone. I think rclone has problem on that. Rclone version 1.72.1 :/).</li>
          <li>Modals now transforms to bottom sheet on mobile devices. Like how it works on gnome. Basic SCSS trick but looks more native.</li>
          <li>Window state persistence support added. Now the app remembers the window size on close and restores it on next launch.</li>
          <li>Added support for additional rclone flags. Users can now configure and pass custom flags to rclone commands through the settings. Some rclone flags are reserved and cannot be used (App prevent these flags to use in the settings).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Removed legacy integrated settings manager in favor of the new rcman library</li>
          <li>Mount plugin detector and installer improved. Dynamic checks for the latest plugin version for installation.</li>
          <li>Terminal remote support removed. App can handle the all remote operations.</li>
          <li>UI simplified and modernized.</li>
          <li>Allow tray icon on headless mode to.</li>
          <li>Headless mode improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Broken theme setting fixed. Now it correctly applies the theme.</li>
          <li>On headless mode cannot open the local files (Access denied error). Now it fixed.</li>
        </ul>

    </release>
    <release version="0.1.9" date="2025-12-20">
      <description>
        <p>Warning</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Since multiple profiles support, the old profiles are automatically migrated to the new profile system. But before the update, please backup your old profiles. If there is a any problem with the new profile system, you can restore your old profiles from the backup and app try the re-migration to the new profile system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Added</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Multiple profiles support added for all operations (Sync, Copy, Move, Bisync, Mount, Serve). Now you can create multiple profiles for each operation and run them separately. Also operation UI has been changed to show profiles. User can configure it from the detailed remote setup modal. User also can select the shared settings and also add a multiple profiles for shared settings to. Quick Remote Access only works with default profile (When you start a action, it uses the default profile).</li>
          <li>Added special Flatpak autostart entry for Flatpak version. Now it creates a desktop entry for Flatpak version of the app. This entry is not handled by Tauri. (Fixed #63)</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added hash calculation support for files. Now you can calculate the hash of a file and copy it to clipboard on the properties dialog.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Added public link generation support for files and directories. If remote supports public link generation, it will be available in the properties dialog.</li>
          <li>Nautilus Component: Enabled download button for remote files. Now you can download remote files to your local machine.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On linux remove the rclone to required dependencies when installing via deb or rpm packages. Because app handle the rclone binary installation and update itself correctly.</li>
          <li>Encrypted export not required standalone 7zip binary anymore. Changed to sevenz-rust crate. Not break the old encrypted exports.</li>
          <li>On tray icon when remote not mounted, it shows the Browse (In App). Basically it opens the RClone Manager's Nautilus with that remote.</li>
          <li>Angular and Angular Material updated to v21 and other dependencies updated to latest stable versions.</li>
          <li>Small design changes on Quick Remote Modal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed</p>
        <ul>

          <li>Broken reduce animations fixed. (issue #60)</li>
          <li>Links openning in the about modal fixed. Now it opens the links in the default browser.</li>

    <release version="0.1.8" date="2025-11-06">
      <description>
        <p>Added</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Developer Setting: Memory Optimization (Destroy Window on Close). Added a new experimental option in Developer Settings that destroys the main window instead of hiding it when closed. This significantly reduces background RAM usage. On Linux, this also actively cleans up lingering WebKit "zombie" processes to prevent memory leaks over long sessions. On MacOS, this not so effective because MacOS version dont use a lot of memory for background processes. But its useful linux and windows.</li>
          <li>Nautilus file manager component added for file browsing. This new file manager component provides a more native and integrated file browsing experience within the app, leveraging Nautilus' capabilities. Currently, it is not supports all features like copy, move, delete, etc. They will be added in future updates. Also support the preview for images, text files and pdf files.</li>
          <li>marked dependency added for markdown rendering in the About modal. This allows us to display formatted release notes fetched from GitHub in a user-friendly manner.</li>
          <li>Support for local path navigation on the remote config. User can now navigate to local paths when configuring remotes that use local file systems.</li>
          <li>Added Flatpak detection and warning banner. If the app is running as a Flatpak, a warning banner will be displayed to inform the user about permission limitations. The banner can be dismissed and will not show again once dismissed.</li>
          <li>VFS Control Panel added to mount and serve pages. Now you can manage VFS instances directly from the app. You can view the status of VFS instances, control their behavior and monitor their queues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Changed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Charts removed from sync, copy, move and bisync activity panels. Also chartjs dependency removed from the project to reduce the bundle size.</li>
          <li>Remote Logs Modal design and functionality improvements.</li>
          <li>Export Modal design and functionality improvements.</li>
          <li>Dashboard General Overview panel design and functionality improvements. Now it supports layout customization.</li>
          <li>App update now support the restart app. Also ask windows users to before updating the app because windows need to close the app to update it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Fixed</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Windows bad looking scrollbars fixed. Now it uses Fluent Overlay scrollbars on Windows for a better look and feel. Also not pushes the content when they appear.</li>

          <li>New time picker module added for better clock time selection.</li>
          <li>Rclone Serve support added. You can now start and stop rclone serve commands. The serve status is displayed in the sidebar for easy access. You can find the serve options in the Serve Tab. Serve configurations (vfs, backend and filter) separated from the other configurations.</li>
